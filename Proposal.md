## _In pursuit of closed loop, fully sustainable, bespoke manufacturing_

## Description

#### [Goals, ideal outcome, what it is you'll be trying to achieve]
The overarching aim of _Genesis_ is to force a greater awareness of the need for **full** sustainability in additive manufacturing technologies. This project seeks to push the aesthetic potential of sustainable 3D printing materials and to mediate a relationship between a digital and 'natural' aesthetic.

This project will be primarily process driven and characterised by a series of structured practical experiments, the results of which be continuously documented and later presented via video/ photographic essay (undecided). Should the results of the experimentation allow for it, it is the hope of this project to produce a wearable garment. The aesthetic of the product and prior experiments will highlight the data driven and algorithmic nature of their development.

It is projected that the practical outcome of this project will germinate the primary philosophical and theoretical concerns of my later MA thesis. Of greatest personal interest to me is in establishing a better theoretical understanding of a continued permeation of the digital realm into the physical. Likewise, should the practical output be physically coherent, it is hoped that the results will be shown in an appropriate exhibitive space.



#### [Research question, if there is one]
What is the aesthetic potential of **fully** biodegradable and sustainable materials for 3D printing? What are the aesthetic implications of data and algorithmic driven development in 'bio' materials?

#### [State of the art / of the Technology]

**Challenges:** The biggest obstacle posed to the progression of this project will be in gaining access to and securing material. The majority of experimental and sustainable materials for 3D printing are currently in their infancy and are predominantly being developed in the US. This may entail the need for the self development of a fully recycled and  sustainable printable material. Companies that are currently researching fully sustainable printing materials include [Emerging Objects](http://www.emergingobjects.com/) and [BioApply](http://www.bioapply.com/en/#).

**Prior Art + Inspiration:** [Continuum](http://continuumfashion.com/N12.php) (3D printed Nylon), [Iris Van Herpen](http://www.irisvanherpen.com/)(laser sintered polymer), [Animalia](http://www.creativeapplications.net/environment/animalia-and-caelum-finding-new-ways-to-interact-with-nature/)(Nature based interactions)


#### [Other relevant factors (cultural, environmental, economical, need, users, etc.)]
![TRASH](trash.jpg)


The initial idea for this project came from a concern over the current predominant use of plastic polymers in 3D printing. While certain materials like PLA(Polylactic acid) are marketed as a 'bio-plastic', natural decomposition of the material requires in excess of 100 years. Likewise, the production methods for creating a plastic polymer from organic materials are acutely hazardous to the environment and generally rely on genetically modified feedstocks(corn starch in the case of PLA).

The environmental concerns of 3D printing are further exacerbated by the increasing access to additive technologies afforded to everyday 'users'; thus arises the possibility of a large amount of low quality, unrecyclable products being generated.

A wearable object has been chosen as a proposed end output product to highlight the inherent dangers and paradox of producing plastic polymer couture garments given the intrinsically transient and impermanent nature of fashion. As mentioned, the production of a garment will not be the primary concern of this project.
